	<h1>Weekly Waste #26 – Boxes & Broken Items</h1>
	
	<h2>New to Weekly Waste?</h2>
	
	<p>Why am I sharing my weekly trash with a bunch of random strangers on the internet? </p>
	<p>Well, I wasn’t happy with the number of trash bags I was going through and knew I didn’t want to continue living the way I was. In an effort to reduce my own waste, I decided to start posting online some of the things I got rid of each week for the world to see, to encourage me to pick up more eco-friendly habits. Intending for the experiment to only last a few weeks, I was shocked to see just how many people would end up viewing my page and so I made the decision to continue the project to this day. </p>
	<p>Before starting this project, I never really thought about what or how much trash I threw away on a regular basis. Each week that I do this, I get more insights into my overall habits which inspire me to make changes in my life. On top of that, I didn’t realize how many memories and stories could be contained in a series of inanimate objects destined for the bin. Compiling each post gives me the opportunity to recap the events of the past week, something I wouldn’t really get the chance to do otherwise. </p>
	
	<h2>Trash Patterns</h2>
	
	<p>Looking at this week’s trash, one pattern I noticed was that many of the items I threw out were things that had been sitting in my room that I didn’t need anymore yet had forgotten to get rid of. This included the empty tissue box and the paper towel roll, which had been long since unused, and the broken mechanical pencil and nail clippers, which both had parts that were still technically functional. </p>
	<p>Compared to previous weeks, two items stood out due to their large size. The blender box and Chick-Fil-A platter were the largest items I’ve gotten rid of in a while and were a little more difficult to dispose of. Some other patterns I noticed were that all the items were of relatively low value and low weight. In addition, many of the items were made of cardboard as they had been packaging for an item I had decided to keep. </p>
	
	<h2>Cardboard Boxes</h2>
	
	<p>The first category of items for this week are all boxes of some kind. The three items in this group include the tissue box, the 3d-printed fractal toy box, and the blender box. </p>
	<p>The tissue box is cube-shaped with an orange, gray, and white blocky pattern and a hole in the top to pull tissue out of. I originally got it from my basement back at home, where we store extra essential items, and needed a new one to put on my desk as I moved into my new room at school. I got random nosebleeds frequently last winter so having one within arms reach was important. Luckily, I haven’t had one yet this season and only used the tissue box for regular use. </p>
	<p>The next item is a small brown box that once held four 3d-printed fractal toys that my younger brother sent me in the mail towards the end of the fall semester. My younger brother has a collection of 3-d printed toys and noticed how much I enjoyed messing around with the fractal ones specifically because of how mesmerizing they were. The box was merely the packaging for the toys and there’s no real reason to keep it around. </p>
	<p>The final item in this group is the large blender box which is mainly white, covered in Nutribullet branding and product information. This past Christmas, I received the blender as a gift from my parents and brought it to school with me so I could make smoothies. In the first smoothie I ever made with the blender I combined banana, strawberry, coconut, and honey. The box for the toys and the blender was just packaging and there’s no real reason to keep them around.</p>
	
	<h2>Broken Items</h2>
	
	<p>The second category of items for this week are made up of a couple of broken items: a pair of nail clippers and a mechanical pencil.</p>
	<p>The nail clippers are reflective silver with a black plastic casing around them. The lever is a dark gray color with a rectangular section for filing nails and squiggly line indents at the end for grip. I acquired the nail clippers as a gift from my parents because I needed my own set. I have used them for many years now and decided to take them with me to my new room at school as I started another semester. Last time I tried to use them, one of the pieces broke causing them to burst into multiple pieces, so I’m getting rid of them and replacing them with a new pair. </p>
	<p>While the incident with the nail clippers was an accident, the broken mechanical pencil was entirely my doing. With a translucent tip, a back plastic body, and a blue eraser part, I first got the mechanical pencil, when I went back to school this past fall. This is not the first one that I have broken (and it probably won’t be the last) as I have a bad habit of jamming the eraser too hard when pushing more lead out, causing the pencil to snap. Technically, it is still usable but tossing it out is probably for the best. </p>
	
	<h2>Roommate Activities</h2>
	
	<p>The last category of items for this week is those that I associate memories with doing random things with my roommates. </p>
	<p>First up we have a small, blue, plastic floss container that, along with the tissue box mentioned above, I grabbed from my family’s storage in the basement back home when I ran out months ago. Back in October, when my roommates were decorating our common room for Halloween, they realized they needed some kind of string to hang something from the ceiling. Rather than going to the store, one of them asked me if they could use a strand of my floss (unused of course), and it ended up working just fine. </p>
	<p>One of the larger items this week was a Chick-fil-a catering platter with a black bottom and a clear top lid. When I first received it, the container was full of Chick-fil-a cool wraps that I somehow ended up taking home after being one of the last people to leave a catered activity. The platter barely fits in the minifridge in my room and ended up sharing them all with my roommates when we stayed inside during the winter storm this past weekend. </p>
	<p>The brown paper tube that once had a roll of paper towels around it had been sitting in my drawer since I used it up last semester. I first got it from Costco as I was picking up last minute necessities before moving into my new place at school. When I found it, I set it on my desk with the goal of getting rid of it but came back to find a small Yoshi plushy had been stuffed into one end of the tube so that only its head poked out. It soon became something my roommates and I would put in random places as a joke just because of how funny it looked.</p>
	<p>Lastly, we have a red and white paper soda cup with a plastic lid that I got from earlier this week. After watching a close and exciting Rutgers basketball game that went into overtime, I went with a couple of my roommates to Sbarro in the Livingston student center because it was the only place open when we got out of the arena at 9pm. As we were getting ready to head to the bus stop, we ran into another one of my roommates who was there for a completely different reason. It used to be our meeting spot last year before we were roommates, so it brought back a lot of memories.</p>

<h2>Item Data</h2>
	
	<h2>Until Next Week...</h2>
	
	<p>This week’s trash was a full-on dorm room clean-out as I got rid of a bunch of items that had been sticking around for a little too long and a few that I had more recently acquired. I want to thank everyone for sticking with me as I continue this project and I hope you can use my experience as inspiration to start something similar on your own. Documenting all the odd stuff you get rid of can be an eye-opening experience and I encourage all of you to give it a try!</p>
	<p>See you next week for another round of Weekly Waste!</p>
